# README file for COVID-19 models (Personal)

The files in this portion of the repository are for some experiments of mine in attempting to develop a (rudimentary) model for use in forecasting various developments with COVID-19.

I cannot attempt to emulate closely any of the more substantial attempts already available online, but I am hoping that these attempts are too specific without necessarily shedding much light on the specifics. (I suppose that I am assuming that unless you know the true biology of the disease, any modeling can be *at best* only a vague reflection of reality.

## Tools

My first thought is that there are several possible alternatives:

1. Python (with frameworks)
2. Stata
3. R
4.  Julia (there is a public domain framework *somewhere*
5. Combinations:
	- Stata and Python
	- Stata and R (?) - I am not sure if this is possible


## Explanations of the models I am creating:

1. crack1
	Simple forays into the use of models in the COVID-19 environment.

2. VSABM
	'Very Simple Agent Based Model' - although I haven't yet settled on a language for its development.
