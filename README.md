# Readme file for modeling project repository

This is meant to be a test bed for modeling projects. I will use STATA initially, but I may try other tools as well.
I will, initially, have separate directories for different language environments, but may later use different subdirectories
for different data projects.

I will begin with two subdirectories, one for STATA coding, and the other for PYTHON projects.
