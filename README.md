# Readme file for modeling project repository

This is meant to be a test bed for modeling projects. I will use STATA initially, but I may try other tools as well.
I will, initially, have separate directories for different language environments, but may later use different subdirectories
for different data projects.

I will begin with two subdirectories, one for STATA coding, and the other for PYTHON projects.

This is the first time in a *long* time that I have edited any files in this repository.
I am still not certain *exactly* what my intentions will be but today I am really just experimenting with the GIT version control system.
Specifically, I am using the command line for these experiments.
