# STATA projects readme file

I will initially begin with a project related to *very* simple pandemic modeling.
For the initial project I will try some pandemic modeling using the built-in facilities available

## STATA Projects

### Pandemic1

The code/data in this section is an exploration of some very simple pandemic models - more to test the value
and usefulness of STATA in this programming genre.

I am editing this file on my computer right now - and will create the subdirectory for the *pandemic1* project.
